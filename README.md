# 💤 LazyVim + Omarchy + ME

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

**Tweaked** for my liking

## Primary Changes

- Keymaps ("jk" babeee)
- Some super basic addition vim option changes
- Disable certain base LazyVim plugins
  - Neo-tree -> remap some basic keybindings
  - blink? -> telescope?
  - CmdLine -> Change back to normal cmdline location (no pop up)
  - Completions -- this I might keep, but with some tweaks
  - Whatever the hell is happening with diagnostics. (UI thing)

### Changes ported over from Omarchy nvim config

- Fancy hot-reloading themes (_requires a symlinked theme.lua file_)
  - For OSX you can just update the theme.lua as needed  
- ??? other stuff (tbh, at this point I'm too unfamiliar with lazyvim to know what omarchy changes.)
